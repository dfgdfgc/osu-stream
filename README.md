# osu!stream

tap, slide, hold and spin to a **beat you can feel!**

## Status

This is basically a “finished” project to me. For more information on the state and history of osu!stream, here's some further reading:

- Read my [blog post](https://blog.ppy.sh/osu-stream-2020-release/) about the final release
- ["osu!stream" on osu! wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/osu!stream)
- Visit the [App Store listing page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osu-stream/id436952197)

While contributions are welcomed I likely won’t have time to review anything too large. There are some exceptions listed below, mostly which fall under the clean-up umbrella – trying to get things into a good final state:

- Bring code standards in line with osu!lazer (using the same DotSettings configuration).
- Doing something about the amount of compile-time `#if`s in the code (especially in `using` blocks).
- Bringing the `arcade` branch up-to-date and potentially merging changes back into master.
- Documentation of any kind.
- Code quality improvements of any kind (as long as they can easily be reviewed and are guaranteed to not change behaviour). Keep individual PRs under 200 lines of change, optimally.

## Running

If you are looking to play osu!stream, the [app store release](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osu-stream/id436952197) is the best way to consume it.

## Building

The primary target of osu!stream is iOS. It should compile with relatively little effort via `osu!stream.sln` (tested via Visual Studio for Mac and Rider).

It will also run on desktop (tested only on windows) via `osu!stream_desktop.sln`. Note that the desktop release needs slightly differently packaged beatmaps (as it doesn't support `m4a` of released beatmaps).

In addition, there is an [arcade branch](https://github.com/ppy/osu-stream/tree/arcade) for the osu!arcade specific release. This branch really needs to be merged up-to-date with the latest master.

## Mapping

The process of mapping for osu!stream is still done via the osu! editor. I believe there was a custom build or mode in the editor to make it easier to place hitobjects at the same point in time, but should be possible out-of-the-box.

Tools for testing beatmaps are included (`StreamTester`) and there is [a branch](https://github.com/ppy/osu-stream/tree/mapper) for building a release of osu!stream with mapper-specific changes (heavily outdated and maybe not useful).

Some documentation exists [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYmHhRX-onR-osgTS6uHSOZuu_0JEbfRZePVySvvr9g/edit?usp=sharing) but beware that you will need some level of expertise to get the tools working and learn the process. If anyone decides to try mapping for osu!stream, I highly encourage you to contribute knowledge back in the form of pull requests to this `README` or a separate `MAPPING.md` if it gets too long.
